# Welcome to in-finit-y

I enjoy configuring and tweaking my system so much, that it's already like I'm
maintaining an own Linux distro.
Here is the documentation of everything that goes into it.

## Dotfiles

The [dotfiles](./dotfiles.html) contain all the configuration files for the programs.

## Scripts

[Shell scripts](./scripts.html) provide simple functionality to the desktop
and background tasks and glue everything in my system together.

## Kherson

[Kherson](https://github.com/alexcoder04/kherson) is my own status line generator
for i3 and sway written in Go and configured in Yaml. Information on
[installation](https://alexcoder04.github.io/kherson/Installation.html) and
[configuration](https://alexcoder04.github.io/kherson/Configuration.html) can
be found on the [project website](https://alexcoder04.github.io/kherson/).

## Cache Manager

The [cache manager](https://github.com/alexcoder04/cache-mgr) is an OpenRC service
to mount a ramdisk on start and create directories for different programs to save
their cache in, as well as loading the firefox profile into this ramdisk.
