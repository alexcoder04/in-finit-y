This was an overview and documentation of everything that goes into my personal Linux system. Some of that might be useful so I decided to make it public.

As I re-worked my config system and didn't have the time to maintain the documentation anymore, this is not up-to-date anymore, so the repo is archived.

However, it can be used as an example how to setup a website on GitHub Pages with Jekyll.

## My new dotfiles

My new collection of dotfiles can be viewed here (most of the stuff has some documentation inside the source code): https://github.com/alexcoder04/infinity
